THIS IS NOT A FULL RELEASE VERSION. THIS IS A BETA VERSION.
Bivot is a simple encoder. It's pretty easy:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO ENCODE A MESSAGE
1) Select your level of encoding
Enter either "A.1", "B.1", or "C.1". "C.1" is the highest level as of yet.

2) Enter your message
Just any message within the charachter limit of N/A.

3) Wait, and Done!
There you go!


TO DECODE A MESSAGE
1) In the begenning tab, select the "DECODE" option

2) Enter your message

3) Wait, and Done!
There you go, with a decoded message.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Bivot works:

Depending on the encoding level, it runs your message through several math programs, and
outputs your message in 'Variables'. These can be numbers, letters, or signs.
Fun Fact: Bivot encodes in versions of 'ENCOLAN', an encoding language.

It also embeds a secret variable in the message that tells the decoder how to decode it.
The reason it's security is high is because it passes through multiple math problems.
It'll turn them into numbers, then do several calculations, and then spit it out.
